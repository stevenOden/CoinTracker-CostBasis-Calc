# CoinTracker-CostBasis-Calc
Parses the output of CoinTracker and calculates the average cost basis for each coin help in each wallet considering all transactions.

This is a script that helps me personally keep track of my cost basis for my crypto coins in all of my wallets so that I know what my capital gains and losses are for tax purposes if/when I sell.
